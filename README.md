A silly shared map experience. Open [Map Stash](http://gpbmike.github.io/mapstash/) in your browser. It will automatically append a key to the url. Copy that and send it to your friends. Have fun looking around the map together.

If you don't have any friends, just open two browsers and you can see how it works by yourself.

Feel free to hack on it or steal it if you want.

Uses [Firebase](http://www.firebase.com) to sync data between users.
